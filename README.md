# HUSC Programming Solutions

This repository stores my personal solutions to programming problems on
[coder.husc.edu.vn](http://coder.husc.edu.vn).

## Repository Structure

- Each solution is organized by **problem code**.
- Source files are named after their corresponding problem IDs
  (for example: `pb0001.cpp`).
